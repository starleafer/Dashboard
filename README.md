The dashboard uses a modern tech stack:

The interface features a modular design where different components (stocks, weather, tasks, etc.) can be arranged and viewed simultaneously.
It supports both dark and light themes for better user experience and is fully responsive, working seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
This makes it more than just a financial tool - it's a comprehensive dashboard that helps users manage various aspects of their daily activities while keeping track of financial markets, weather, and tasks all in one place.
